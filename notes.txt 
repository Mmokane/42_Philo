mutexes ;

A Mutex is a lock that we set before using a shared resource and release after using it.

first step to do is making a mutex variable, and name it (pthread_mutex_t (name));
then we initialize the mutex (pthread_mutex_init (&name, NULL)); i sitll need to know
about the second argument on the init function;
then we need to destroy the mutex (pthread_mutex_destroy (&name));
now we go to the section of code we want to lock nad we lock it using
(pthread_mutex_lock (&name)), to release that lock , we call the 
fucntion (pthread_mutex_unlock (&name));
